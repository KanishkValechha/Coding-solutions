/*
 * 1. Two Sum
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * 
 * Given an array of integersnumsand an integertarget, returnindices of the two numbers such that they add up totarget.You may assume that each input would haveexactlyone solution, and you may not use thesameelement twice.You can return the answer in any order.Example 1:Input:nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9Output:[0,1]Explanation:Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].Example 2:Input:nums = [3,2,4], target = 6Output:[1,2]Example 3:Input:nums = [3,3], target = 6Output:[0,1]Constraints:2 <= nums.length <= 104-109<= nums[i] <= 109-109<= target <= 109Only one valid answer exists.Follow-up:Can you come up with an algorithm that is less thanO(n2)time complexity?
